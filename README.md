# Message Bubbles
Message bubbles is a Minetest mod that uses the existing nametags above player heads to display chat messages sent by the player.

The maximum length of the messages shown, the duration for which these messages are shown and the prefix (if any) can all be configured (for servers, by adding to `minetest.conf`). See `settingtypes.txt` file for config names.
